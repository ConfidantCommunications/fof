; This file is used to tell Akeeba Strapper which files it should NOT load at
; all. The file located in your site's media/akeeba_strapper works globally,
; both in the front- and back-end. WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND NOT TO USE IT AS IT
; WILL BREAK THE BACK-END OF YOUR EXTENSIONS!
;
; Instead, we urge you to copy this inside your site template's directory. For
; example, if you have a template named foobar, copy this file to:
;
; /templates/foobar/media/akeeba_strapper/strapper.ini
;
; and modify the options below, depending on what you want to achieve.

; ======================================================================================================================
; NOTE FOR DEVELOPERS REGARDING CHANGES IN VERSION 2.3.3
;
; Our namespaced copy of jQuery is always loaded. This is not a bug and not subject to any further change. Unfortunately
; there are many badly written templates and plugins which either REMOVE jQuery altogether or load an incompatible
; version instead of the one shipped with Joomla!. This causes grave issues with our components. As a result we are now
; always loading a namespaced (akeeba.jQuery) copy of our known good version.
;
; Furthermore, to avoid any conflicts with properly written Joomla! extensions and Joomla! itself, we are preloading
; all of our CSS and JS files using an onAfterRender handler which injects the CSS/JS in the header, before anything
; else has the chance to load. This also avoids the problem caused by some templates and plugins which na√Øvely assume
; that all JS files can by placed at the bottom of the page or, even worse, loaded with the async flag.
;
; Finally, for performance and space saving reasons, the support for LESS files inclusion has been removed.
;
; If you do not like any of these changes please fork Akeeba Strapper under a different name, using a different
; namespace for your Javascript. The changes described above are final decisions, taken with the best interest of our
; clients and our company in mind. Any patches / PRs which negate any of these changes will be ignored.
