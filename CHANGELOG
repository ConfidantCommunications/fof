Backwards compatibility notes
----------------------------------------
* Since Joomla! 3.2 Beta 1 JFormField comes with a magic __set method which drops
  property assignments of any property JFormField is not aware of. This means that
  in order for your custom fields to work you need to add the following two public
  variables in your custom field class:

	/** @var   FOFTable  The item being rendered in a repeatable form field */
	public $item;
	
	/** @var int A monotonically increasing number, denoting the row number in a repeatable view */
	public $rowid;

  Failure to include them will result in an error message when trying to use your
  custom field in a browse form.

Note for older versions
================================================================================
 FOF 2.1.rc3 is the first version of FOF shipped with Joomla! itself. Changes
 prior to this (i.e. changes before October 9th, 2013) were not tracked in this
 changelog.
