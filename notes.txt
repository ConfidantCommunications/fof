NOTES FOR TINKERERES
================================================================================

When importing a new Bootstrap release you have to:

• Rename bootstrap.css to bootstrap.less and add this at the top:
     .akeeba-bootstrap {
  and this at the bottom of the file:
     }
  then compile it with a LESS compiler such as SimpLESS

• Remove all .modal definitions; the conflict with Joomla!
